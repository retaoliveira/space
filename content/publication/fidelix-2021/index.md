abstract: "This research aims to characterize consumer behavior when purchasing essential goods before and during the pandemic caused by the COVID-19, and retailers’ perception during this pandemic period, as well as to relate the impact of such changes in urban supply logistics. Two questionnaires were applied in regions classified as BOP (Base of Pyramid) and descriptive and multivariate analysis were performed using cluster analysis. The research shows that there is an increase in the consumer’s purchase frequency, which also increases the demand from retailers and the logistic needs of the regions evaluated, weakened mainly by the lack of infrastructure and spaces for loading and unloading. The results show that there was an increase in purchases acquired by delivery applications during the pandemics, which seems to be a trend, which may require from these regions a better road infrastructure for large (used by suppliers) and individual vehicles (used by deliverers).
